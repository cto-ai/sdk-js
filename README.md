# CTO.ai SDK

This is the Node.js SDK for the [CTO.ai](https://cto.ai/) Ops
Platform. It wraps a daemon process, written in Rust, that implements
a variety of rich user interactions in the terminal.

Documentation for this SDK is found at
[https://cto.ai/docs/sdk-api](https://cto.ai/docs/sdk-api). The
easiest way to create a project using this SDK is to install the Ops
CLI
([https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cto.ai/ops](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cto.ai/ops))
and run the `ops init` command.

your team, visit [https://cto.ai/docs/](https://cto.ai/docs/).
